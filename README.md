Heroes Of Grannard, The Open Source Roguelike Ascii Game!


Heroes of Grannard is fully open source. You may use the code to create your own game, and no credit is required at all! If you really wanted to you could redistribute it as is, I won't take offense, but keep in mind that credit would be much appreciated if you plan to do that.
